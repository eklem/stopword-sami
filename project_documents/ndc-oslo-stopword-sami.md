## Outline

* What are stopwords
* What does the work with stopword-sami consist of
* NRK as a text source and how to improve the stopword lists over time. Manual work, redlists and content crawling.
* Solutions a stopword list can help you create: search engines, chatbots, plagiarism detection, sentiment analysis and other machine learning solutions.
* Demo North Sami stopword list to show what simple linguistic understanding can do

## Quick about myself

* I have no Sami relatives or ancestors and I don't speek or understand any of the Sami languages. I've created stopword lists for Punjabi Gurmukhi- and Finnish language before. I'm doing this because I think it's needed.

* Maintained and developed the module stopword since 2017. Was my way of starting to learn JavaScript, Git, GitHub, NPM and open source development.
